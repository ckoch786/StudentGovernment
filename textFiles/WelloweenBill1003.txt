Welloween Bill 1003-B-102511

Section 1: The Problem
Student government is always looking for a way to better the lives of
students on campus. Many students still submit themselves to tanning booths
despite the warnings of malignancies. Student Government is looking to grow and
involve more students. To do this we must market ourselves as much as possible.
Section 2: The Solution
The Student Rec Center hosts a health fair known as Welloween Friday
October 28th from 11:30 to 1:30. This provides tables of health tips to students as
well as rocket ex class demos and free flu shots. Student Government can sign up to
have table with information about Skin Cancer. Also those at the table will promote
student government as well as a special ‘Watcha Want Welloween’.
Section 3: Implementation
Student Government will have a table from 11:30 to 1:00 at Welloween. The
table will provide information about skin cancer: what to look for, increased rates in
multiple ethnic backgrounds, and ways to prevent. Student Government will
provide information on when senate meets and what they do as a body as well as
the roll of cabinet and SJC. At least one person will have their ‘Whatcha Want’ shirt
with a clipboard taking suggestions from students and later sending them to the
Vice Chair of Senate. Those Senators that participate in working the table will gain
a service hour. If participating in Whatcha Want Welloween, this will count as the
senator’s mandatory participation for the semester.
