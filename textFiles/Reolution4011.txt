Whereas, most college students struggle with financial obligations, and,
Whereas, it would be convenient to have access to local discounts, and,
Whereas, it would promote UTSG because students would have to access the list through the
UTSG website, and,
Whereas, it will promote the sales of local businesses, and,
Therefore, let it be resolved, that the Student Government of the University of Toledo supports
providing a complete list of business discounts available on the UTSG website and providing a
link to businesses that accept Rocket Cards.
