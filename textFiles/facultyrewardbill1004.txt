A Bill to establish a “Faculty Award” at the University of Toledo

Authors: President Matt Rubin and Vice President Jordan Maddocks
Sponsors: Academic Affairs Committee
I. Defining the Problem
a. Currently outstanding faculty members are not recognized enough for
their efforts.
II. The Solution
a. An established “Faculty Award” at the University of Toledo where
students directly nominate faculty members to a “Faculty Award
Board” where they will pick a winner monthly.
III. The Implementation
a. Students will nominate faculty outstanding through student
government web page every month.
b. Information will be compiled into the Student Government database.
c. Academic Affairs Committee, Student Government President and Vice
President, and Senate Chair will pick the winners monthly. The basis of
the award shall be determined on their accessibility to students,
teaching methods, and ability to lead by example.
d. Student Government will invite the monthly winner to Senate and
present them with a “Faculty Award” certificate and a “Student’s First”
pin. At the end of the year, Student Government will invite all of the
monthly winners to a banquet, with Dr. Jacobs and Provost in
attendance, to congratulate the yearly winner.
