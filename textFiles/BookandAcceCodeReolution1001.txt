Book and Access Code Resolution 1001-R-092011
-A resolution to suggest that faculty inform students what materials are
needed prior to classes starting
Author: Senator Emily Kinney, Andrew Wettle
Sponsors: Academic Affairs
Whereas, student’s plans and other monetary needs for a semester
prior to the beginning of semester, and the amount needed includes
textbooks and other required material such as access codes, and
Whereas, professors and faculty in charge of classes do not always let
students know that they will need to purchase something for class until
the first week of classes, this throws off previously calculated
expenditures, and requires that the student come up with extra funds
to succeed in the class.
Therefore let it be resolved, faculty must allow students to be aware of
materials in need of being purchased one week before the tuition bill is
due for the University,
Let it further be resolved, that Student Government encourages all
faculty to use The University of Toledo’s bookstore to list textbooks and
other material required for courses.
