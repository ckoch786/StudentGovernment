Whereas, A student referendum was passed through Student Government in 2007
supporting the implementation of the USA Today Campus Readership Program through
General Fees, and due to Ohioâ€™s tuition and fees freeze, the program could not be added,
and

Whereas, in 2009, the University of Toledo Office of External Affairs began to fund the USA
Today Campus Readership Program, which delivered copies of the USA Today to campus for
students to read free of charge to supplement education and awareness of current events as
well as provide faculty members a resource for assignments and projects regarding current
events, and

Whereas, in the fall of 2011, the USA Today Readership Program was discontinued due to
financial constraints in the Office of External Affairs, leaving USA Today Newspaper
containers unfilled and students without a hard copy daily news source, and

Whereas, on September 27th 2011, over 400 students signed a petition asking for the USA
Today Campus Readership Program to be reinstated, gave video testimony and responded in
a positive manner to bringing back the program, and

Whereas, Student Government represents the voice of the University of Toledo Student
Body, advocating for its best interests and requests, and

Whereas, the USA Today Campus Readership Program can provide opportunities for
Student Government to promote civic engagement, global awareness and media literacy on
campus.

Therefore, Let It Be Resolved, that as the voice of the students, Student Government
formally requests and supports the reinstatement of the USA Today Campus Readership
program at the University of Toledo for the remainder of the 2011-2012 academic calendar,
and

Let It Further Be Resolved, that Student Government will seek out the funding of this
program to the best of its ability, and

Finally, Let It Be Resolved, that Student Government will pursue a referendum in the
Spring of 2012 to continue the USA Today Collegiate Readership Program through Student
General Fees.
