person for online classes as well as regulate aptitude with the blackboard
system

Where as, Students often take online classes out of convenience to their
academic and work schedules. They expect to follow a well constructed syllabus
and use a well constructed website that is easy to use.
Where as, Online classes are currently not meeting studentsâ€™ expectations.
Faculty can require students to be present in an actual classroom setting or take an
exam at a set time even though it is not in the course description.
Where as, Faculty is not providing detailed syllabi and is not knowledgeable about
the Blackboard system.
Therefore let it be resolved, Student Government recommends that faculty
teaching an online course must let students know that there will be an in person
requirement prior to the student signing up.
Furthermore let it be resolved, Faculty must provide a detailed syllabus for due
dates, assignments, and exam/quiz dates. Faculty teaching an online course must
prove proficiency in using the Blackboard system or complete the Blackboard
training.
