Guest Speaker
• Jeff Bowman (assistant treasurer of the university)- looking into having
students use social security numbers more during registration, etc.
• Using social security numbers would assist in getting financial aid and saving
money in various areas
• Collecting social security numbers would also prevent duplicate records for
students with the same name
• Social security numbers would be collected during the registration process
rather than during the freshman application
• Social security numbers would be pooled in a highly secure place where only
a few individuals have access to it
