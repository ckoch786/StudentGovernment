OSU vs UT Ticket Raffle Bill
Section 1: The Problem
We currently have 14 Senators and Student Government has allotted 50 seats to
represent over 20,000 students.
Section 2: Method of Solution
In an attempt to bring in more people to senate meetings and hopefully have those
people want to join Student Senate, Student Government will be offering an
incentive.
Section 3: Implementation
Student Government will purchase 2 (two) tickets to the September 10, 2011
University of Toledo at Ohio State University football game. The cost of the
tickets will be: $160.
Student Government will raffle the 2 (two) tickets to any University of Toledo
student at the September 6, 2011 Senate meeting.
In order to qualify for the raffle, you must adhere to the rules of the raffle. These
rules are:
1. You must not be a member of Student Government.
2. You must be here at the start of the Senate meeting (8:15 pm) and stay
until the meeting is over.
3. If you disrupt the meeting, you will be asked to leave. This will
disqualify you from the raffle.
Actions that would be considered a disruption would include:
-Talking loudly with others
-Cell phones ringing
-Disrupting Senate procedure
4. You must prove you are a student at The University of Toledo.
5. You must give Student Government permission to take your photo and
the rights to publish that photo.
