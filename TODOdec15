"Student Government Documents" On that page I would like
there to be a clickable link for
   1.) constitution
   2.) bylaws
   3.) Senate Code of Conduct
   4.) Senate Standing Rules

--Update senators and legislation

--Student Judicial Council- Get email addresses for all involved
  by searching the campus directory by last name

--Fix the Request to Speak Form
