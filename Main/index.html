The University of Toledo Student Government is your voice on campus. As Student Senators, we voice needs and concerns of our fellow Rockets to the proper administration staff members to ensure that the student perspective is always heard. Student Senators are here to serve the student body through advocacy, oversight, and advancing new initiatives, like through our “100 Great Ideas for UT” legislation program.
</p>
<br />
<p>
In our 47th session, extending from Fall 2011 through Spring 2012, we will help create a better University of Toledo for you and strive for “MORE” as the University’s current ad campaign states. For example, we have helped to install two full service locked bike corrals on both the east and west ends of campus, equipped with rentable lockers and free air to maintain your bicycle. We are constantly striving to increase campus involvement and interactions and communicate better with you, our student body and constituency.

<p>
If there is anything your University of Toledo Student Government can do for you, never hesitate to contact us on Facebook, Twitter, by phone, or in person in Student Union 3512. Furthermore, never hesitate to join Student Senate as a Senator-At-Large, so your voice can be heard directly. If you have any questions or would like to be more involved, please contact Student Government President Matt Rubin or Chair of the Senate Heather Engle.
