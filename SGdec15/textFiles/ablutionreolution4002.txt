Whereas, Muslims are required to perform a procedure commonly called
“ablution”, in which they wash parts of their bodies, mainly the face, arms, and feet,
with water before engaging in prayer and,
Whereas, Muslims are required to perform a minimum set of five prayers each day,
each with defined time frames throughout the day and,
Whereas, an average of three of the five mandatory prayers which each Muslim
must perform each day fall during their time of presence on campus and,
Whereas, the only designated area of prayer for Muslims on campus accessible to
all students is the MSA prayer room located in the Student Union room 3516, where
they therefore also usually perform their ablution and,
Whereas, it is inherently difficulty to perform ablution on a small, high sink, that a
mess is often being created in the bathrooms next to the MSA prayer room (SU
3516) and,
Whereas, many from the non-Muslim community have complained about the mess
and,
Whereas, those from the Muslim community have noted their inconvenience in
performing the procedure, in a large part because they feel they are being
disrespectful to the rest of the restroom users when having to raise their feet to the
sink and,
Whereas, the third floor bathrooms are shared by most student organizations
located there, such as the Student Government, Latino Student Union, Black
Student Union, Spectrum, and others, it must be kept clean and sanitary and this
would be to the benefit of everyone who uses these restrooms and,
Whereas, a similar designated ablution area has previously been installed in the
Horton International House, but is inaccessible to most students.
Therefore, Let It Be Resolved, that the Student Government supports the
construction of two special “ablution” areas, one in each gender bathroom, in the
third floor bathrooms located close to room SU 3516, in the form of small low sinks
and,

4002-R-102511

Let It Be Further Resolved, that plans be drafted by the end of the November
2011 and a call for contractors be released thereafter, so construction may take
place over the Christmas break, and the ablution area may be opened at the start of
the Spring 2012 semester.
