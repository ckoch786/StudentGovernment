Resolution 4008-R-112911
A resolution stating that Student Government fully supports the
University of Toledo’s newly implemented main campus smoking
restrictions.
Author: Senator Jimmy Momenee
Whereas, smoking is an annoyance and an obstruction of student
health and well-being, and an obstruction of the ability to breathe
clean air on campus, and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has implemented a law banning smoking
within 30 feet of exterior doorways, and
Whereas, the University of Toledo has furthered the state approved
smoking ban for the sake of students’ health by implementing a total
of seven bus stop enclosures for smokers to use while on main
campus.
Therefore, let it be resolved that, the Student Government fully
supports the University of Toledo’s decision to implement the smoking
restrictions.
