Bill 6006-B-102511
-Formation of a Student Government Ad Hoc Committee
Author: Senator Alison Wery
Section 1: The Problem
The Student Government office represents Student Government as much as the
members do. The office is unorganized, unclean, and unprofessional, which is not
the impression that speaks highly of the organization. To show the University of
Toledo that Student Government is an established and professional organization
then the office needs a great deal of improvement.
Section 2: The Solution
An ad hoc committee will be formed by volunteers from Student Government
(executive, SJC, and senate) to improve the office. Meetings will be on Monday at
9pm where the volunteers will meet and discuss how the office should be enhanced.
Section 3: The Implementation
The ad hoc committee will have two-three weeks to form a plan to present to
Student Government for approval.
