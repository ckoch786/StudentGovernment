Whereas, students have busy schedules, and
Whereas, students often have a need to work on homework or study
late at night, and
Whereas, many of the assignments students work on require the
Internet, and
Whereas, many students like to use the Carlson Library, and
Whereas, the first floor of the Carlson Library often is crowded or noisy
from midnight to 2am.
