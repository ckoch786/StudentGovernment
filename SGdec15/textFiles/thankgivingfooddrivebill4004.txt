-A bill to support the underprivileged people of the Toledo community.
Author: Heather Engle
Section 1: The Problem
1. There are many families in the Toledo area that need help.
2. There are many Senators that have multiple absences.
Section 2: The Solution
1. Any Senator that brings in 5 nonperishable food items will have onehalf absence removed from their record.
2. Any Senator that brings in 8 nonperishable food items will have one
whole absence remove from their record. A max on one whole
absence can be made up from this food drive.
3. Donations may be made at the November 15, 2011 or the
November 22, 2011 Senate meeting or be taken to the Student
Government office until November 22, 2011.
4. The food items will be taken to Toledo Northwestern Food Bank.
5. Any Senator that volunteers to help deliver the items will have that
time applied to their mandatory service hours.
Section 3: The Implementation
1. Any donation made for absence credit should be made with a note
attached to the bag/box with the Senator’s name on it. Do not write
your name on any of the items being donated, as the food bank will
not be able to accept it.
2. The Vice Chair will remove the absence from the Senator’s record.
3. Any Student Government member may volunteer their time to help
deliver the items to the Toledo Northwestern Food Bank. The items
will be delivered on November 23, 2011.
