A Bill to sponsor an event on September 16th, 2011 with the office of Governmental Affairs to celebrate
Constitution Day
Problem: A Federal mandate requires all public institutions in the United States of America to recognize Constitution
day. The University of Toledo Student Government traditionally sponsors such an event.
Method of Solution: Student Government and the office of Governmental Affairs will sponsor a panel discussion on
the constitution on September 16th at 11:30am in the Student Union South Lounge. The discussion panel will be
moderated by Student Government President Matthew Rubin. Panelists will include Toledo Judge Dean Mandros,
UT Professor Dr. Morris Jenkins, UT Law Professor Dr. Lee Strang, and UT Law Student Kyle Bristow. The topics
of discussion will focus on executive powers and will include Federal Spending, War Powers and the recent
Healthcare Mandate. Free pocket constitutions and cake from Costco will be provided by the office of Governmental
Affairs and distributed to those in attendance. Student Government will be responsible for promoting the event.
