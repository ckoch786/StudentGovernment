Just a back up of files that I maintain for the Student Government.
You may see some things that go against standards, this is because
I have limited file permissions that approach zero. So in order to
get any functionality at all I have to find ways around the security.

I hope to change this in the near future by requesting to have 
the site hosted off campus.
